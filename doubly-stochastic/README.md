# Exploration of matrix multiplication with doubly stochastic matrices

`Nov-8` notebook shows that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinkhorn's_theorem#Sinkhorn%E2%80%93Knopp_algorithm converges really fast.

So it's not difficult to keep multipliers close to being doubly stochastic with the advantage being that
the product is also doubly stochastic (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_stochastic_matrix)
